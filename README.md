# Machine Learning Portfolio
 

A repository of the projects I worked on or currently working on. It is updated regularly. The projects are in Python (Jupyter Notebook). Click on the projects to see full analysis and code.


###  [ML_World_Bank_Economic_predictions  - Under Construction]([https://github.com/Martagilant/EDA/blob/main/main.ipynb](https://github.com/Martagilant/ML_WHO_Economic_predictions/blob/main/main.ipynb))

* Machine learning model predicting which countries will be the most attractive opportunity to invest in, GDP growthis a key economic marker for this.
* Obtained from kaggle dataset: [(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/georgejdinicola/world-bank-indicators/data)]
* Supervised regression problem.
* LightGBM was used as our predictive model, focusing on RMSE optimization.
* Final RMSE against test: 5.7536
* Visual analysis: bar plot, boxplot, pie chart, scatter plot and heat maps.
* Keywords(Python, Kaggle, WHO, Analysis, Trends, Predictions)
